# Jan 30 2026 - What to do the following week

## 1.  K8s vs k3s;  
### try out k3s, and see if anything similar or different

## 2. Containerization app, build an image, consume the cpu 
### try to build a new image, and write a script or an api that consumes cpu(set to 50), try to run HPA see if anything should be happening happens(the scaling, the cpu usage raise up as expected)

## 3, metrics: cpu, replicas, timestamp, invocations, delay
### metrics that should be collected

## 4. Poisson distribution. 
### use the given dataset to simulate the real situation, and see if I can make the request fairly distributed in that one minute. 

## 5. Cool down time. 
### the scaling cool down time, manual setting to see if the scaling changes

## 6. 2 scripts, watch collect metrics, terminal. Script, request. 
### run two scripts in to terminals, and see if there's anything nicer that could make requests
