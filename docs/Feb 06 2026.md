# Jan 30 2026 - What to do the following week

## 1.  Load balance;  

check out how containers/apps perform/scale/behave in pods when scaling happened (requests arrive), so that we know what's going on.

And also check out how spa scale up ( how is cpu_cur_util calculated, what's the scale standards  here)


## request time lasted

Check out how long would a request usually lasts, give some backup knowledge to how to choose what kind of cpu consumer api to use


## tools

Look for more stress testing tools, see how they consumes cpu, get some examples to look at and apply for it.

Also look for tools that generates web requests, see if anything helpful.

# metrics

Gather running data and calculate to get some metrics such as (all data collected per 15s, and metrics calculated base on average data per minute): 

violation_rate: how many times that the cpu usage is over the target / total counts, 

violation_sum: sum of percents that violation situations' over the target's standard /times that violation happened,

average_resource: what's the average cpu usage over the minutes
